# guessing_game
A little and simple guessing game for my introduction to the python language. 
In this simple guessing game the user tries to guess a drawn number.  
The purpose of this game was the initial learning in python language. 
This game can be interesting if you are learning this language.
I apologize if there are any grammatical errors in English.
